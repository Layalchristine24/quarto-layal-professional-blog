*My Certified ScrumMaster Training Experience with DasScrumTeam*

In November 2022, I attended the Certified ScrumMaster Training conducted by [DasScrumTeam](https://www.dasscrumteam.com/) at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Zurich. The two-day training equipped me with the knowledge needed to pass the [Scrum Alliance](https://www.scrumalliance.org) Online Test and attain the [Certified ScrumMaster certification](https://certification.scrumalliance.org/accounts/1446608-layal-christine/certifications/1689119-csm).

The training was comprehensive, covering Scrum concepts and principles in an accessible manner. The instructors were experienced and passionate about Scrum, making the learning process engaging and effective.

By the end of the training, I felt well-prepared to take the certification test. Moreover, the interaction with fellow participants allowed for valuable knowledge sharing and networking opportunities.

For those considering ScrumMaster certification, [DasScrumTeam](https://www.dasscrumteam.com/)'s training program is a worthwhile choice to gain the necessary skills and knowledge.
